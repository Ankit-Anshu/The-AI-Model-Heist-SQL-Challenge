# The AI Model Heist: SQL Challenge
## Investigate the Data Theft with SQL

On the morning of November 15th, 2024, VortexAI reported a major data breach. VortexAI wasn't just any startup, they were about to launch a revolutionary AI model that could transform the entire industry.
Tragically, their revolutionary AI model was stolen and leaked to competitors. The security system shows no signs of external access, which means someone  within the company is responsible. Detective Ankit needs your help to find out who did it. Your task is to use SQL queries to analyze the data and identify the person behind the crime.

 **Time of the incident:** 2 AM - 4 AM.

## What you need to solve on your computer

**AI_Model_Heist_SQL_Challenge.sql:** MySQL dump file to set up the database.

**database_create.sql:** MYSQL code to create the database from scratch.

**AI_Model_Heist.db** This SQLite database file contains all the data that you will be working with. For beginners, we recommend using SQLiteStudio, 

**Python:** If you prefer Python, CSV files are provided for the challenge tables. Load them using libraries like pandas.

## Hints to Solve
1. Find who was in the building during the incident
2. Check what files were accessed during this time
3. Look specifically for access to the AI Model file
4. Check for large Data transfers
5. Check Network Traffic Specifically for the AI Model File
6. Get Complete Activity Log for Suspicious Employees
7. Check Their Security Interview Statements
8. Compile All Evidence Against the Suspect
