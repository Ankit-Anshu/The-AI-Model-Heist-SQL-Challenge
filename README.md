# The AI Model Heist: SQL Challenge
## Investigate the Data Theft with SQL

On the morning of November 15th, 2024, VortexAI reported a major data breach. VortexAI wasn't just any startup, they were about to launch a revolutionary AI model that could transform the entire industry.
Tragically, their revolutionary AI model was stolen and leaked to competitors. The security system shows no signs of external access, which means someone  within the company is responsible. Detective Ankit needs your help to find out who did it. Your task is to use SQL queries to analyze the data and identify the person behind the crime.

 **Time of the incident:** 2 AM - 4 AM.
